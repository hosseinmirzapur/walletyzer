## Learning Objectives

This project helps you learn:
- **Anchor Basics** - Writing simple Solana programs
- **Frontend Integration** - Connecting React to blockchain
- **Wallet Connection** - Using Solana Wallet Adapter
- **Data Fetching** - Getting wallet and token information
- **UI Development** - Building clean, responsive interfaces

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev                    # Start development server

# Anchor Development
cd anchor
pnpm anchor keys sync       # Sync program keys
pnpm anchor-build          # Build the program
pnpm anchor-localnet       # Start local Solana validator
pnpm anchor-test           # Run tests

# Production
pnpm build                 # Build for production
pnpm start                 # Start production server
```

## Key Components

### Wallet Connection
- Uses `@solana/wallet-adapter` for easy wallet integration
- Supports multiple wallet providers
- Clean connection status UI

### Account Display
- Shows wallet address and basic info
- Displays SOL balance prominently
- Lists all token holdings

### Token Management
- Fetches and displays SPL tokens
- Shows token balances and metadata
- Clean token list interface

## No Backend Needed!

This project demonstrates how to build useful Solana applications using:
- **Client-side data fetching** - Direct RPC calls
- **Anchor programs** - For any smart contract needs
- **Local development** - Anchor's localnet for testing
- **Frontend state management** - React hooks and context

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Start with wallet connection** - Get this working first
2. **Use localnet for testing** - No need for devnet initially
3. **Focus on one feature at a time** - Build incrementally
4. **Use the Anchor TypeScript client** - It's generated for you
5. **Test with small amounts** - Use devnet when ready for real testing
